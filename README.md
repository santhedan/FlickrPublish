NOTE:

Application is no longer available on App Store as shelling out $100 / year was expensive for me. You can still compile this application and sideload it on your device and use it. The Flickr API interface has not changed so the application will still function. Also the Flickr app now allows you to add your photos to multiple group - if you want to use that.

# FlickrPublish

An iOS App that makes adding your photos to Flickr group easier!

If you are a Flick user and regularly publish photos to multiple groups, you will agree that it takes a lot of time.

The Flickr web and mobile application allows adding photos to groups one after the other. the web experience is betrer but the application experience is horrible.

I tried to raise this issue multiple time by giving feedback to Yahoo! but nothing has happened so far.

Hence I decided to create this application: The application flow is simple right now.

1. When you start the application for the first time, it will ask you to authorize the application using your Flickr account.

2. You will need to login using your Flickr credentials and allow the application access to your account (Don't worry - The application is not designed to publish anything!)

3. It will then list all your photo sets

4. Select a photo set to see all the photos inside - This will take time if you have many photos in your photoset. It will only download first 500 photos for now.

5. These photos are low resolution and are locally stored so from next time onwards it will load much faster. Any new photo added to the set will downloaded. Any removed photo will not show up.

6. Then you select a photo that you want to add it to one or more group (this application is designed for the "more group" use case)

7. It will then list all groups that the photo can be added to - All groups that the photo is already part of is not listed at all.

8. Now select your groups and then tap "Add"!

9. That's it.
